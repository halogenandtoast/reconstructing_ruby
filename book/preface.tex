This book is not a primer on C. It assumes that you have a passing knowledge of C programming. If you've never programmed in C before it's highly suggested that you read the book "C Programming Language, 2nd Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie -  which is often referred to as "K\&R".

This book has been written for two purposes. The first is to provide a better understanding of Ruby's internals, potentially allowing readers to contribute to Ruby. A second goal is to provide a better understanding of interpreters in general. The second goal opens up the possibilities for readers to create their own interpreted languages.
