\chapter*{Preface}

This book is not a primer on C. It assumes that you have a passing knowledge of C programming. If you've never programmed in C before it's highly suggested that you read the book "C Programming Language, 2nd Edition" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie -  which is often referred to as "K\&R".

In addition this book expects its readers to be able to search online for terms not discussed in detail in this book.

This book has been written for two purposes. The first is to provide a better understanding of Ruby's internals, potentially allowing readers to contribute to Ruby. A second goal is to provide a better understanding of interpreters in general. The second goal opens up the possibilities for readers to create their own interpreted languages.

This book was heavily influenced by Pat Shaughnessy's "Ruby Under a Microscope".
